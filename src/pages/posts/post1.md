# Concert Reviews
### Amy, New York (2024 World Tour):
> Attending Eminem's concert was like stepping into a time capsule filled with all the moments that made him the icon he is today. The energy in the arena was palpable from the first beat. Hearing Lose Yourself live was an emotional high I wasn’t prepared for—his delivery felt as raw and powerful as the first time I ever heard it. The crowd sang every word, and it felt like a shared moment of connection, even with thousands of strangers. He also performed Stan, and the emotion in his voice left everyone completely silent. Eminem's ability to command the stage is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. It wasn’t just a concert; it was an experience, a reminder of why he’s considered one of the greatest in the industry. Walking out of the venue, I felt inspired and grateful to have been part of something so incredible.
